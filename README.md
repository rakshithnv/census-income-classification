Problem Statement:

In this project, initially you need to preprocess the data and then develop an understanding of the different features of the data by performing exploratory analysis and creating visualizations. Further, after having sufficient knowledge about the attributes, you will perform a predictive task of classification to predict whether an individual makes over 50,000 a year or less by using different machine learning algorithms.

Tasks Performed : Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to find key insights. Use various machine learning algorithms to predict the response variable Models Implemented:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest Classifier.
